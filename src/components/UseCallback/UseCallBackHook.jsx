// useCallback is a React Hook that is used to memoize a callback function.
//  This helps prevent unnecessary re-creations of functions on every render, which can be important for performance optimization,
//  especially when passing functions as props to child components that are wrapped in React.
//  memo or when the callback is a dependency of other hooks.
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react'
import Child from './Child';
